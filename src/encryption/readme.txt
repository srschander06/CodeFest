TLS still required: This message-level encryption does not eliminate the need for TLS. Use HTTPS for protecting metadata, cookies, headers, and mitigating active network attackers.

Key storage: The server's private key in this example is stored as a PEM on disk for convenience. In production, use an HSM / cloud KMS / sealed storage.

Authentication & binding: In the example any client can call /upload-user-public-key and register a user_id. In production, require authentication and bind the stored public key to the authenticated user (or use signed certificates).

Replay protection: Consider including timestamps/nonces in plaintext before encryption if you need to prevent replay attacks.

Forward secrecy: This is not forward-secret between sessions because server's RSA private key can decrypt all AES keys encrypted to it. To get forward secrecy, use ephemeral Diffie-Hellman per session or rotate server keys frequently.

LLM trust model: The server (or its operators) with the server private key can read the original prompts encrypted to the server. If your goal is that nobody (including the server operator) can read prompts/responses, you need confidential compute (enclave) or a different trust arrangement where the LLM is run in an environment that holds the decryption key but is opaque to admins.
